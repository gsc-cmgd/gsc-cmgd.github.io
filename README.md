# Introduction
Development and Research Website for Geoscience and Mineral Exploration 

This is a repository of the Geoscience and Mineral Exploration Research. 
These models are development to support [Mineral Prospectivity Models for Critical Minerals in Canada](https://geo.ca/initiatives/critical-minerals/) 

Research on Critical minerals potential in Canada is one of the key strategic priorities, supporting multiple goals and objectives related to development and prosperity. They are materials essential for technology, energy production and storage, defense, housing and infrastructure. The demand for critical minerals is rising quickly and it’s important to diversify the supply to reduce supply shortages and price fluctuations.

To help Canadians discover new and more responsible sources of critical minerals in Canada, Canadian federal, provincial, and territorial geological survey organizations, academia and research community as well as the private sector collaborate to provide public geoscience tools and products. The responsible development of these new critical mineral deposits promotes economic growth, strengthen supply chains, and safeguard Canada’s essential industries and creates new jobs.

Here is a list of relevant research. 

# Mineral Hotspot analysis

Hotspot analysis of Critical Minerals in Canada using 6 Mineral Prospectivity Models

Research on Hotspot Analysis (Getis-Ord G*) based on a composite mineral score derived from six mineral prospectivity models (MPMs). The goal is to identify significant spatial clusters (hotspots) of high critical mineral potential across Canada using standardized spatial units (H3, Level 7).
