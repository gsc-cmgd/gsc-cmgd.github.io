Development and Research Website for Geoscience and Mineral Exploration 

This is a repository of the Geoscence and Mineral Exploration research. 
Some models are development to support [Mineral Prospectivity Models for Critical Minerals in Canada](https://geo.ca/initiatives/critical-minerals/) 

Critical minerals are materials essential for technology, energy production and storage, defense, and infrastructure. The demand for critical minerals is rising quickly and it’s important to diversify the supply to reduce supply shortages and price fluctuations.

To help Canadians discover new and more responsible sources of critical minerals in Canada, Canadian federal, provincial, and territorial geological survey organizations collaborate to provide public geoscience tools and products. The responsible development of these new critical mineral deposits will promote economic growth, strengthen supply chains, and safeguard Canada’s essential industries.

Manufacturing electrical wires requires copper minerals like tetrahedrite.
